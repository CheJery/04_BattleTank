Concept:


You control a tank and fight against other tanks. These tanks can be player controlled or controlled by AI. Your goal is to shoot the other tank/s and not get shot in the same time. The game is played on a map with obstacles that you can’t shoot through and need to drive around.
Rules:


 * The game is won when the other tanks are all destroyed
 * Every tank has a limited amount of health
 * When the tanks health hits 0 he is destroyed and can’t battle anymore
 * You need to stay on the map
 * Finite Ammo


Requirements:


 * You’ll need to control the tank, drive and shoot
 * Ballistics for shots need to be calculated
 * Physics for driving on terrain need to be implemented
 * Sounds for shooting and hitting stuff (other tanks, obstacles, nothing)
 * Sound for getting shot
 * Visual effects for getting hit/hitting and being destroyed/destroying


Not implemented:


 * Different types of tanks
 * Reparation of tanks
 * Individually destroyable objectives and tanks
 * Teams
